# DATA_502-Data_Viz
Files from class

Not super glamorous, but these are some results of homework assignments completed for my graduate level Data Visualization course. Course focuses on the communication aspects of graphics, and how statisticians can use data to tell a story.  Not intended for any other audience than my professor.  

I am new to GitHub and it's capabilities, but I hope to improve quickly.
